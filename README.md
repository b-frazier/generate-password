# Strong Password Generator

The user will be able to select a password length from 8-18 characters.

The password will contain a combination of special characters, numbers, capital and lowercase letters.

We were given the code for this project but I wanted to learn to do it from scratch. I found alternative ways to generate random letters, numbers and symbols through online resources and tutorials.

I really like how this turned out and was worth the extra effort. I would like to find a way to make the "Password copied!" message disappear if a new password is generated.

I figured out how to reset the copy message on the start of generating a new password.
